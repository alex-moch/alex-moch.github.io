            <p>I received all of my higher education from the University of Mannheim.</p>
            <p>
              In school, I was always good at math and had an interest in economics. So, I obtained my Bachelor's degree
              in Mathematics in Business and Economics. I also took a couple of courses in computer science and decided
              that I wanted to pursue that path.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Master's program in Business Informatics offered a wide selection of courses. I took most of my
              courses in computer graphics and theoretical computer science, with a few in data mining and finance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, I decided to pursue a doctorate in cryptography. This was not a structured program but rather
              consisted of mostly independent research, along with other duties, that eventually resulted in a thesis.

            <p>My research focuses on creating more resource efficient schemes.</p>
            <p>
              My doctoral research was dedicated to provable security in the random oracle model. Here, some building
              blocks were replaced with perfectly random counterparts, which then allowed to prove lower bounds on
              security. This demonstrated the absence of generic attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              The big picture is to find <q>small</q> schemes with good security properties. These can then be
              implemented in hardware with little implementation cost.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on that research, we proposed a stream cipher called DRACO. Currently, I am working on stream
              ciphers that can withstand attacks by an adversary with a quantum computer.

            <p>I was involved into teaching several lectures and seminars.</p>
            <p>
              Teaching has been a very significant part of my work. I was responsible for the tutorials for all the
              courses we offer, either by supervising teaching assistants or by teaching the tutorials myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I was fully in charge of organizing the seminars we offered. Of course, there were also
              exams to be graded and theses to be supervised.
